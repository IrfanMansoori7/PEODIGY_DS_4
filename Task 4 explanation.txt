In this project, we analyzed sentiment patterns from social media data to understand public opinions on different topics and brands. We cleaned and preprocessed the data, applied text vectorization techniques, trained classification models, and evaluated their performance. Our work included creating visualizations to represent sentiment trends and feature importance, providing valuable insights into how people feel about various subjects.
